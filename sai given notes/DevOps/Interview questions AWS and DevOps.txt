1. NRPE port number --> 5666
2. NRPE: Nagios Remote Plugin Executor -> allows you to remotely execute Nagios plugins on other Linux/Unix machines.
                                       -> allows you to monitor remote machine metrics (disk usage, CPU load, etc.)
									   -> NRPE can also communicate with some of the Windows agent add ons, so you can execute scripts and check metrics on remote Windows machines as well.
									   
3. Telnet port number: 23

4.How to check particular port is running or not using telnet remote server?
#telnet <i.p> <portnumber> (Note: you need to install telnet your system)

5.How to configure SSL certificate?
. first you need to download the certificate and key files on related domain owner site.
. once you have download that files copied to your server location perticular path.
.finally enable SSL : these two files location path mention into related webserver conf location.

example:  <VirtualHost 192.168.0.1:443>
          DocumentRoot /var/www/website
          ServerName www.domain.com
          SSLEngine on
          SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/crt/primary.crt
          SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/crt/private.key
          SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/crt/intermediate.crt
          </VirtualHost> 

6. How to upgrade docker container ?

7. how to create git branch ?

8. how to merge git branch to master?

9. how to troubleshoot to merge a branch into master?

10. How should I control the versions of my project on GitHub?

11. How to run multiple jobs run at atime in jenkins ?
You can use a pipeline to tie the jobs together, executing them either in parallel or sequentially through steps.

12. Recover Lost Key Pair of AWS EC2 Linux Instance?

13. what is VPC? difference between public and private subnet?

14. what is difference between public ip and private ip?
A public IP address is assigned to your instance from Amazon's pool of public IP addresses it's not associated with your account.
When a public IP address is disassociated from your instance, it's released back into the pool, and is no longer available for you to use.
You cannot manually associate or disassociate a public IP address.
However,If you require a persistent public IP address that can be assigned to and removed from instances as you require, use an Elastic IP address.

The public IP you get when an instance is created (and you opt to give it a public IP) is ephemeral.if you stop that instance, when you start it up you'll get another random public IP.
So, Public IP get's changed everytime for an instance after stop/start.
To overcome with this problem, we attach an Elastic IP to an Instance which doesn't change after you stop / start the instance as many times.

Advantage of Having Elastic IP
-> It is kind of static IP for your Instance.
-> Doesn't change after stop/start.

15. what is netmask?
A netmask is a 32-bit mask used to divide an IP address into subnets and specify the network's available hosts. In a netmask, two bits are always automatically assigned. 
For example, in 255.255.225.0, "0" is the assigned network address. In 255.255.255.255, "255" is the assigned broadcast address. The 0 and 255 are always assigned and cannot be used.

16. what is subnet mask?
Subnet masks are used to design subnetworks, or subnets, that connect local networks.
It determines both the number and size of subnets where the size of a subnet is the number of hosts that can be addressed.

17. how to install apache package in different OS family?

Now when the package name is the same across different OS families, it's as simple as:

---
- name: Install foo
  package: name=foo state=latest
  
When the package name differs across OS families, you can handle it with distribution or OS family specific vars files:

---
# roles/apache/apache.yml: Tasks entry point for 'apache' role. Called by main.yml
# Load a variable file based on the OS type, or a default if not found.
- include_vars: "{{ item }}"
  with_first_found:
    - "../vars/{{ ansible_distribution }}-{{ ansible_distribution_major_version | int}}.yml"
    - "../vars/{{ ansible_distribution }}.yml"
    - "../vars/{{ ansible_os_family }}.yml"
    - "../vars/default.yml"
  when: apache_package_name is not defined or apache_service_name is not defined

- name: Install Apache
  package: >
    name={{ apache_package_name }}
    state=latest

- name: Enable apache service
  service: >
    name={{ apache_service_name }}
    state=started
    enabled=yes
  tags: packages
  
Then, for each OS that you must handle differently... create a vars file:

---
# roles/apache/vars/default.yml
apache_package_name: apache2
apache_service_name: apache2

---
# roles/apache/vars/RedHat.yml
apache_package_name: httpd
apache_service_name: httpd

18. Delete empty lines using SED ? (How to deleate empty lines in text file)
#sed -i '/^\s*$/d' file.txt

19. How to use sed to find and replace text in files in Linux / Unix shell ?
--> The sed stands for stream editor.
--> It reads the given file, modifying the input as specified by a list of sed commands.
#sed -i 's/old-text/new-text/g' input.txt

-> s = is the substitute command of sed for find and replace.

#sed -i -e 's/word1/word2/g' -e 's/xx/yy/g' input.file --> to change multiple words at time using sed.

20. what is autoscaling ?
21. what is elastic ip ?
22. what is difference between nacl and security groups ?
--> The difference between Security Group and ACLs is that, Security Group act as a firewall for associated Amazon EC2 instances, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level,
    while ACLs act as a firewall for associated subnets, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
	
23. VPC Peering ?
--> A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately. 
    Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. 
	You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, with a VPC in another AWS account, or with a VPC in a different AWS Region.

1.How to monitor jenkins build jobs?
-> install Build monitor plugin in jenkins
-> Create a new view and select Build Monitor View

2.what is POM?
-> POM is a xml file which contains the project configuration details used by Maven. 
-> It provides all the configuration required for a project.
-> POM means Project Object Model & as the name suggests it defines the model of the project as well.
-> In the normal project development you will add jar files & libraries as required.In maven based development, those jars, libraries are added to the project using this pom.xml.
-> In the pom context we call those jars, libraries as Dependencies.
