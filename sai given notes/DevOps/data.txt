what is devops?

-> Devops is practices and set up a roles.
-> Dev + ops our main aim is it reduce the gap b/w develper activities and ops activities we need to delivery the code continuous by using these devops tools. 
-> DevOps is founded on building a culture of collaboration between teams.
-> DevOps is a set of practices that automates the processes between software development and IT teams, 
in order that they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.

-> Getting code from the dev and putting into the prod.

-> Automation : getting code from develper , testing automatically going into the production , and going into the last stage of production.

-> Delivery: you are moving into the product from one env to another env.
use: data center public and private,cloud.

-> devops uses: they are getting one person many roles
when the product is going from pre-prod to prod it is called CD.

CI and CD:

For example muttiple develpers working on the same application each of them have there own feature and bug fix they are working on and they are contributing same application
into the same code repository.

Code repository could be version control system like GIT HUB.
when develper push's the code to the repository it is build to the link management system like Jenkins that takes the code and build it.
once test pass successfully we can confirm build cycle is complete.

CD:

what we do once testing is completed successfully next step is to release next version of the application
Relasing the software this way automatically to a pipe line is know as continuous Delivery.
Next step is to take a package then automatically deploy inthere Env.
This process automatically updating production env with the changes inthe application is ref to continuous deployment.

when the application code is changed and push to the code repository automatically build and tested to a build pipe line then release the release management system and finally deploy to production in the target env.
